The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and then those six words are listed alphabetically. For example, a possible result is $AB$, $CJ$, $DG$, $EK$, $FL$, $HI$. The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
