                "content": "We need arcs on circumcircle of triangle DEF (midpoint triangle). Points G on BD, H on AE, J on AF (line segments from vertices to midpoints). G, D, E, H, J, F are points on that circumcircle in that order. We need arc lengths DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG.\n\nWe need to compute central angles subtended by these arcs. Since arcs are on circumcircle of triangle DEF (the medial triangle). Need to locate where G, H, J lie (intersection of circumcircle with lines from vertices to opposite midpoints). Might be related to known properties: The circumcircle of triangle the nine-point circle of original triangle ABC. Indeed, nine-point circle passes through midpoints D, E, F and also feet of altitudes, and midpoints of segments from orthocenter to vertices. However G, H, J are intersection of nine-point circle with lines BD, AE, AF. Are these points the midpoints of the segments from vertex to orthocenter? Actually the line from vertex A to midpoint of BC (D) is a median. Its intersection with nine-point circle is one point besides D (call G). Similarly lines from B to midpoint of AC (E) median BE intersect nine-point circle at H? Wait they say AE line, but median from B is to midpoint of AC, which is E; line AE is from A to midpoint of AC (i.e., a median from A actually goes to D. So AE is not a median, it's a segment from A to the midpoint of AC, that's just a half of side? Actually A to midpoint of AC is a segment along side AC, not a median. Wait: E is midpoint of AC, so AE is half of side AC (a sub of side). So H is intersection of nine-point circle with AE (other than E). Similarly AF is subsegment of side AB, J is intersection with AF.\n\nAnd BD is a median from B to midpoint D of BC; G is intersection other than D. So G is on median BD.\n\nThus we need arcs lengths between these points on nine-point circle.\n\nPerhaps we can use angles: For any chord XY on a circle, the measure of arc XY equals the central angle, also twice the inscribed angle subtended by the chord.\n\nWe can consider quadrilaterals on nine-point circle.\n\nKey: The nine-point circle is the circumcircle of triangle DEF and also of triangle formed by the feet of altitudes. But we might use property that the nine-point circle is homothetic to circumcircle of ABC with factor 1/2 and same center as the Euler circle? Actually homothety at the nine-point center N with factor 1/2 maps circumcircle to nine-point circle? The nine-point center N is the midpoint of the segment between orthocenter H (not same as our H) and circumcenter O. The nine-point circle is the image of the circumcircle under homothety with center the orthocenter? Wait: The nine-point circle is the image of the circumcircle under homothety with center the orthocenter and factor 1/2. Yes, the nine-point circle is the circumcircle of the medial triangle, which is homothetic to the circumcircle of ABC with homothety center at the centroid? Actually the medial triangle is formed by midpoints, so it's homothetic to ABC with center at the centroid G (not the orthocenter). The scaling factor is 1/2. Hence its circumcircle (nine-point circle) is also homothetic to circumcircle of ABC with same center G and factor 1/2. Wait: The circumcenter of medial triangle is the nine-point center N, which is not generally the centroid. Homothety of triangle ABC to triangle DEF is with center at the centroid and factor -1/2? Actually midpoints are obtained by homothety of factor 1/2 with center at any vertex? No, mapping each vertex to midpoint of opposite side requires a different center. But the whole triangle transforms via homothety with center at the centroid (intersection of medians) and factor -1/2 (to get midpoints of sides but orientation reversed). Indeed the centroid G (let's denote centroid as Gc) maps each vertex to the midpoint of opposite side under homothety factor -1/2. So triangle ABC is rotated 180 degree? Wait, a homothety with factor -1/2 about centroid sends each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side (since centroid divides median in ratio 2:1). So that works. So the nine-point circle is homothetic to the circumcircle with same center? Not same center; homothety with center at centroid Gc maps circumcenter O to nine-point center N (midpoint of O and H). Actually the homothety with center at centroid maps O to N? Need to verify: Coordinates wise, centroid is (A+B+C)/3. Circumcenter O is not linear combination, but homothety with factor -1/2 maps O' = Gc + (-1/2)(O - Gc) = (3Gc - O)/2. Not equal to N necessarily. So maybe not.\n\nAlternate approach: Use angle chasing. Since points D, E, F are midpoints, we know some angles in triangle DEF are same as in ABC.\n\nLet's compute coordinates or use law of sines? Could compute intersection points using known geometry.\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC with known angles. We don't need side lengths; using circumcircle geometry maybe easier to compute angles between lines BD and the nine-point circle.\n\nObservation: Points D, G, B are collinear, with D on nine-point circle, B outside. G is other intersection of line BD with nine-point circle. So chord DG corresponds to line through B. So B is external point intersecting the circle at D and G. Similarly, line AE meets circle at E and H (with A external). AF meets at F and J.\n\nThus (B, D, G) as power of point: BD * BG = power relative to nine-point circle. Similarly for A with lines AE and AF.\n\nWe may find arcs via angle subtended by chord DG at some point on circle (e.g., at H or J). But we can use measure of angle D G B? Actually angle formed by chord DG and line DB with external point B.\n\nHowever we can find inscribed angle: Since D,G are points on the circle, the measure of arc DG equals 2 * angle DFG? Not helpful.\n\nBetter: Use property that the external point B lies on circumcircle of triangle ABC. Might be relationship between nine-point circle and the original circumcircle: The angle between a line through B and the nine-point circle is related to the angle subtended by that line at the circumcircle.\n\nAlternative: Use coordinates. Let's set triangle ABC with convenient coordinates: Use unit circumradius R=1 for circumcircle of ABC. Place circumcircle centered at origin O with radius 1. Then points A,B,C have known angular positions corresponding to angles of triangle. The central angles are twice the opposite angles: arcs BC = 2∠A = 168°, etc. Let's compute.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with angles: A = 84°, B=60°, C=36°. The circumcircle arcs opposite vertices: arc BC (not containing A) subtends angle A at the circumference, so its central angle = 2*A =168°. Similarly arc CA central angle = 2*B =120°, arc AB central=2*C=72°. The arcs sum to 360°, indeed 168+120+72=360.\n\nThus we can assign coordinates on unit circle: Let’s place point A at some angle, say at coordinates (1,0) for convenience? Actually we can set positions: Let’s put A at angle 0 (point (1,0)). Then moving counterclockwise, arc AB = 72°, so point B at angle 72° (since central angle from A to B is 72°). Then arc BC = 168°, so point C at angle 72+168 = 240° (or -120°). Check: then arc CA = 120°, from C to A: 360-240 =120, matches.\n\nThus coordinates:\n\nA = (cos0, sin0) = (1,0)\n\nB = (cos72°, sin72°)\n\nC = (cos240°, sin240°) = (cos(240) = -1/2, sin = -√3/2) (since 240°).\n\nCompute B numerical: cos72° = cos(72) ≈ 0.3090169, sin72°≈0.9510565.\n\nNow we can compute midpoints D,E,F:\n\nD is midpoint of BC: D = (B+C)/2.\n\nE midpoint of AC: (A + C)/2.\n\nF midpoint of AB: (A+B)/2.\n\nNow the nine-point circle is circle passing through D,E,F. Its center N is midpoint of circumcenter O (0,0) and orthocenter H_orth. But could compute directly: find circumcenter of triangle DEF by solving.\n\nAlternatively, note that nine-point circle is homothetic to circumcircle (radius R=1) with factor 1/2 and center at the circumcenter of medial triangle? Actually the nine-point circle radius is R/2 = 0.5? The nine-point circle radius equals half the circumradius of ABC. Indeed nine-point radius = R/2. Since for any triangle, nine-point circle radius is R/2. So its circle radius is 0.5, centered at the nine-point center N, which is the midpoint of O and H (orthocenter). But we could also find N as circumcenter of triangle DEF.\n\nThus radius = 0.5. So nine-point circle is known: radius 0.5. Its center N we can compute as (O+H)/2.\n\nWe also can locate points D,E,F coordinates, then compute N as circumcenter of DEF: intersection of perpendicular bisectors.\n\nMight be easier to compute arcs via angles at N. Since the circle radius is 0.5, we can compute angular coordinates of D,E,F,G,H,J with respect to center N (angles measured from some reference). Then arcs are differences.\n\nThus need N coordinates. Compute orthocenter H of triangle ABC given coordinates A,B,C on unit circle. For triangle on unit circle, orthocenter vector = A+B+C (as complex numbers). Indeed for triangle inscribed in unit circle centered at origin, orthocenter H (as vector) equals sum of the vertices (as complex numbers). So in vector terms: H = A + B + C. Since O=0.\n\nThus compute H vector sum.\n\nFirst, get coordinates:\n\nA = (1,0)\n\nB = (cos72, sin72) ≈ (0.3090169, 0.9510565)\n\nC = (cos240, sin240) = (-0.5, -0.8660254)\n\nSum:\n\nx: 1 + 0.3090169 -0.5 = 0.8090169\n\ny: 0 + 0.9510565 -0.8660254 = 0.0850311\n\nThus H ≈ (0.8090169, 0.0850311)\n\nNow nine-point center N = midpoint of O(0,0) and H: N = (0.40450845, 0.04251555).\n\nRadius = 0.5 * R = 0.5.\n\nCheck distance from N to D should be 0.5.\n\nNow compute D, E, F coordinates:\n\nC = (-0.5, -0.8660254)\n\nB = (0.3090169, 0.9510565)\n\nD = ((B_x + C_x)/2, (B_y + C_y)/2) = ((0.3090169 -0.5)/2, (0.9510565 -0.8660254)/2) = (-0.1909831/2?, wait compute: 0.3090169 + (-0.5) = -0.1909831. Half = -0.09549155. Y: 0.9510565 + (-0.8660254) = 0.0850311. Half = 0.04251555.\n\nThus D ≈ (-0.09549155, 0.04251555)\n\nInteresting: D's y coordinate matches N's y coordinate 0.04251555! Indeed D lies directly left of N horizontally? Let's compute N = (0.40450845, 0.04251555). So D shares same y coordinate; line ND is horizontal.\n\nSimilarly compute E: (A + C)/2 = ((1 -0.5)/2, (0 -0.8660254)/2) = (0.5/2 =0.25, -0.8660254/2 = -0.4330127). So E = (0.25, -0.4330127)\n\nF: (A + B)/2 = ((1 + 0.3090169)/2, (0 + 0.9510565)/2) = (1.3090169/2 =0.65450845, 0.9510565/2 =0.47552825). So F ≈ (0.65450845, 0.47552825)\n\nNow verify distances from N to these points:\n\nCompute N to D vector: D - N = (-0.09549155 - 0.40450845, 0.04251555-0.04251555) = (-0.5, 0). Length = 0.5. Good, since radius.\n\nN to E: (0.25 -0.40450845 = -0.15450845, -0.4330127 - 0.04251555 = -0.47552825). Compute squared magnitude: (-0.15450845)^2 ≈0.023876, (-0.47552825)^2≈0.226001≈0.249877 ~0.25 => radius 0.5. Good.\n\nN to F: (0.65450845 -0.40450845 = 0.25, 0.47552825 -0.04251555 =0.4330127). Square: 0.0625+0.1875=0.25. Good.\n\nThus consistent.\n\nNow we need points G, H (I'll denote H_pt maybe not to confuse with orthocenter), and J.\n\nG is second intersection of line BD with nine-point circle.\n\nWe have B coordinates (0.3090169,0.9510565). D coordinates given. We can parametric line BD: B + t*(D - B). At t=0 we have B; at t=1 we get D. The second intersection besides D corresponds to t such that point is on circle centered N radius 0.5. Since D already lies on circle. So we solve for t ≠1 that satisfies distance to N =0.5.\n\nLet vector v = D - B = (-0.09549155 -0.3090169, 0.04251555 -0.9510565) = (-0.40450845, -0.90854095). Compute.\n\nParam point P(t) = B + t*v.\n\nWe need |P(t) - N|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.\n\nPlug in.\n\nCompute N coordinates N = (0.40450845,0.04251555).\n\nLet’s define w(t) = P(t) - N = (B - N) + t*v.\n\nFirst compute B - N: (0.3090169 -0.40450845 = -0.09549155, 0.9510565 -0.04251555 = 0.90854095). Interesting: B - N = ( -0.09549155, 0.90854095). That's basically negative of v except y sign? v = (-0.40450845, -0.90854095) while B-N = (-0.09549155, 0.90854095). Not simple.\n\nNow compute squared magnitude: |B - N + t*v|^2 = 0.25.\n\nWe know for t=1 (point D) we have D - N = (-0.5,0). Let's check: D-N = (-0.09549155-0.40450845 = -0.5, 0 So magnitude squared =0.25. Good.\n\nThus t=1 is solution. Quadratic will have two solutions, product maybe.\n\nWe can solve linear using formula for line-circle intersection. Since we have one known point D (t=1), we can find other using chord power: Since B is external point, the power of B = (BD)*(BG). BD distance = |B - D|. Compute BD length: magnitude of v = sqrt((-0.40450845)^2 + (-0.90854095)^2). Compute squares 0.163637 +0.825457 ≈0.989094. sqrt ≈0.99453. So BD ≈0.9945.\n\nLet the other intersection distance BG = ? Then power: BD * BG = power = distance squared from B to center N minus radius^2 (but B is outside). Compute BN distance: BN = |B - N| = sqrt((-0.09549155)^2 + 0.90854095^2) = sqrt(0.009118 +0.825457) = sqrt(0.834575) ≈0.91357. Power = BN^2 - r^2 = 0.834575 - 0.25 = 0.584575.\n\nThus BD * BG = 0.584575. BD ≈0.99453. So BG = 0.584575 / 0.99453 ≈0.5879.\n\nThus G is located on line B->D beyond D? Since D is between B and G? Let's see: B to D distance ~0.9945, BG distance ~0.5879, which is less than BD, meaning G is between B and D? Actually BG measured from B to G along line, if G between B and D, BG < BD. Yes G would lie between B and D (i.e., closer to B). But D is on circle on that line; the second intersection could be on the opposite side of D relative to B, but that would make BG > BD. Since we found BG < BD, G is between B and D. But note D is a point on circle, B is outside; line meets circle at two points: one nearer to B (call G) then passes through circle interior and exits at D (farther). So D is farther from B, yes.\n\nThus parameter t from B to D: D corresponds to t=1 (since P = B + v). G would correspond to t = BG/BD? Actually BG = distance from B to G = t_G * |v|, where t_G is proportion along vector v from B. Since v points from B to D. If G is between B and D, then 0< t_G <1. So t_G = BG/|v| = BG/BD ≈0.5879 /0.9945 ≈0.591. So t_G ≈0.591.\n\nThus G coordinates = B + t_G * v.\n\nCompute v = (-0.40450845, -0.90854095). Multiply by t_G ~0.591: v*t = (-0.239, -0.537). More precisely:\n\n0.40450845*0.591 = 0.239 (approx). So x: -0.239, y: -0.537.\n\nAdd to B: B x 0.3090169 + (-0.239) = 0.0700. y: 0.9510565 + (-0.537) = 0.414.\n\nThus G ≈ (0.07, 0.414).\n\nCheck distance from N: N is (0.4045,0.0425). Vector G-N = (-0.3345, 0.3715). Length sqrt(0.112 +0.138) = sqrt(025)=0.5 good.\n\nNow compute angular coordinate of point on nine-point circle relative to N. Compute angle θ such that point = N + 0.5 * (cosθ, sinθ). So compute vector vG = G - N = (-0.3345, 0.3715). Normalize by radius .5 to get direction (cosθ, sinθ) = ( -0.669, 0.743). Compute angle: θ_G = atan2(0.743, -0.669) ≈? atan2 positive y, negative x → quadrant II. Compute arctan(|y/x|)= arctan(0.743/0.669=1.111). arctan(1.111)≈48°. Since x negative, y positive, angle ≈ 180-48 =132°. So θ_G ≈132°.\n\nSimilarly compute angles for D, E, F.\n\nD - N = (-0.5, 0). So direction (-1,0) corresponds to angle 180°.\n\nE - N = (-0.15450845, -0.47552825). Divide by 0.5: (-0.3090169, -0.9510565). That's cosine/sine of angle? That's point at angle? cos = -0.309, sin = -0.951 → angle ~ 251°? Since cos negative, sin negative, angle between 180 and 270. atan2(-0.951, -0.309) approx -108° from positive x, which is 252°. Indeed 252°.\n\nF - N = (0.25, 0.4330127). Divide by 05 (.5, 0.8660254) → angle 60°.\n\nThus we have angular positions (in degrees) on nine-point circle (center N) measured from positive x-axis (east) direction.\n\nLet's summarise:\n\n- D: 180°\n- F: 60°\n- E: 252°\n- G: approx 132°\n- Need H (point on AE line) and J (on AF line). Compute similarly.\n\nCompute line AE: A (1,0) to E (0.25, -0.4330127). Find intersection with circle besides E.\n\nParameter A + s*(E - A). Vector u = E - A = (0.25-1 = -0.75, -0.4330127 - 0 = -0.4330127). So u = (-0.75, -0.4330127). At s=1 we reach E (on). Need s_H for other intersection with circle (0 < s < 1 maybe). Using power of point from A.\n\nCompute distance from A to N: AN = |A - N|. A - N = (1 -0.40450845 = 0.59549155, 0 -0.04251555 = -0.04251555). Length squared =0.5955^2 +0.0425^2 =0.3546+0.0018=0.3564. Radius^2 =0.25. Power = AN^2 - r^2 =0.3564-0.25=0.1064.\n\nCompute AE distance = |u| = sqrt(0.75^2 +0.4330127^2) = sqrt(0.5625 +0.1875)= sqrt(0.75)=0.8660254.\n\nLet t = s (distance from A to point along line). Intersection distances: AE * AH? Actually for line from external point A intersecting circle at E (farther) and H (nearer). Distances along line from A: Let AH = x, AE = 0.8660 (farther). Then power = AH * AE = 0.106 -> AH = power/AE =0.1064 /0.8660 ≈0.1229.\n\nThus AH is much smaller than AE, so H lies between A and E, close to A.\n\nThus fraction s_H = AH / AE = 0.1229 /0.8660 ≈0.142.\n\nThus coordinates H = A + s_H * u.\n\nCompute u scaled: u *0.142 = (-0.75*0.142 = -0.1065, -0.4330*0.142 = -0.0615). Add to A (1,0): H ≈ (0.8935, -0.0615).\n\nCheck that H lies on circle: compute vector H - N = (0.8935-0.4045=0.489, -0.0615-0.0425= -0.104). Length squared approx 0.489^2=0.239, plus 0.0108=0.2498 ≈0.25 good.\n\nNow compute angle θ_H: vector (0.489, -0.104) normalized by 0.5 gives (0.978, -0.208). Angle atan2(-0.208, 0.978) ≈ -11.8° (or 348.2°). So θ_H ≈ 348.2°.\n\nNow compute J on AF line: A (1,0) to F (0.65450845, 0.47552825). Vector w = F - A = (-0.34549155, 0.47552825). Length AF = sqrt(0.3455^2 +0.4755^2) = sqrt(0.1194+0.2261)= sqrt(0.3455)=0.5878. Good.\n\nPower of A same as before =0.1064. So AJ = power / AF = 0.4 /0.5878 =0.1810. So J is between A and F, distance 0.1810 from A. Parameter s_J = AJ / AF = 0.1810 /0.5878 =0.308.\n\nCoordinates J = A + s_J * w = (1 + 0.308*(-0.3455), 0 + 0.308*(0.4755)) = (1 -0.1064, 0.1465). So J ≈ (0.8936, 0.1465).\n\nVector J - N = (0.8936-0.4045 =0.4891, 0.1465-0.0425=0.1040). That's just opposite y sign to H vector. So (0.4891,0.1040). Normalize: (0.9782,0.208). Angle atan2(0.208,0.978) ≈ 11.8°. So θ_J ≈ 11.8°.\n\nThus we have the angular positions in order around circle as given: The order around circle is G, D, E, H, J, F (as per problem). Let's check our computed angles sorted ascending (starting 0° and going ccw):\n\nθ values:\n\nF: 60°\nJ: 11.8° (actually 11.8° is less than 60°, but order stated maybe starting elsewhere. Let's list all:\n\nθ_G ≈132°\nθ_D =180°\nθ_E =252°\nθ_H =348.2°\nθ_J =11.8°\nθ_F =60°\n\nIf we go increasing from 11.8°, we have J (11.8), F (60), G (132), D (180), E (252), H (348), then back to J. The problem says order G, D, E, H, J, F. That order maybe clockwise direction? Let's see if clockwise (decreasing angles) gives that: Starting at G 132°, decreasing: D 180°? Wait decreasing from 132 would go to 60, then 11.8 etc. So perhaps they go clockwise opposite direction. Let's compute clockwise (decrease) order: Starting at G 132°, next decreasing would be J? No J is 11.8°, that's less. However D is 180°, which is greater. So maybe they list order clockwise but starting at some point. Not crucial; arcs we need: arc DE meaning minor arc from D to E along circle (the shorter one). Since D at 180°, E at 252°, the minor arc from ccw is 72° (252-180 =72). Could also go other way 288°, but minor is 72.\n\nArc HJ: minor arc between H (348.2°) and J (11.8°). Difference across 0°, compute (360-348.2)+11.8 = 12°? Wait 360-348.2 =11.8, plus 11.8 =23.6°. Let's compute precisely: 360 - 348.2 = 11.8 (coincidentally same as J angle). So total 11.8+11.8=23.6°. Should be maybe 24° due to round errors. Likely exact is 24° (since angles are nice). Indeed our approximations gave H at 348° (i.e., -12°), J at 12°, so arc HJ = 24°.\n\nArc FG: minor arc between F (60°) and G (132°): difference 72°.\n\nThus arcs: DE = 72°, HJ = 24°, FG = 72°.\n\nNow compute expression: DE + 2*HJ + 3*FG = 72 + 2*24 + 3*72 = 72 + 48 + 216 = 336.\n\nThus answer 336.\n\nCheck integer between 0-999, yes.\n\nLet's verify consistency: Might be exact 336.\n\nTherefore final answer: \\boxed{336}.</think>The nine‑point circle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is the circumcircle of the medial triangle \\(DEF\\).  \nSince \\(\\triangle ABC\\) has angles \\(84^\\circ,60^\\circ,36^\\circ\\), its circumcenter is the origin of the unit circle, and the nine‑point circle has radius \\(\\tfrac12\\) and centre \\(N\\), the midpoint of the orthocenter and the circumcenter.\n\nPlacing the vertices on the unit circle:\n\n\\[\nA(1,0),\\qquad \nB(\\cos72^\\circ,\\sin72^\\circ),\\qquad \nC(\\cos240^\\circ,\\sin240^\\circ).\n\\]\n\nThe midpoints are  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD&=\\Bigl(\\frac{B_x+C_x}{2},\\frac{B_y+C_y}{2}\\Bigr)=\\Bigl(-\\frac{1}{2\\! \\,}\\!+\\!0.4045,\\;0.0425\\Bigr),\\\\\nE&=\\Bigl(\\frac{A_x+C_x}{2},\\frac{A_y+C_y}{2}\\Bigr)=(0.25,-0.4330),\\\\\nF&=\\Bigl(\\frac{A_x+B_x}{2},\\frac{A_y+B_y}{2}\\Bigr)=(0.6545,0.4755).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe nine‑point centre is  \n\n\\[\nN=\\fracO+H}{2}=\\Bigl(0.4045,\\;0.0425\\Bigr),\\qquad\\text{radius }r=\\tfrac12 .\n\\]\n\nUsing the power of a point for the external points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{on }BD:\\;BD\\cdot BG=BN^{2}-r^{2}=0.5846,\n\\\\[2pt]\n&\\text{on }AE:\\;AH\\cdot AE=AN^{2}-r^{2}=0.1064,\n\\\\[2pt]\n&\\text{on }AF:\\;AJ\\cdot AF=AN^{2}-r^{2}=0.1064,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwe obtain the second intersections \\(G,H,J).
